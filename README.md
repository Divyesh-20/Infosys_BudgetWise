## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Forecasting
```python
# Load the trained model
import pickle
with open('real_random_forest_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Make predictions for specific categories
prediction = model.predict(feature_matrix)
```

### Budget Optimization
```python
# Calculate personalized budget recommendations
monthly_income = 75000
savings_rate = 0.20
budget_suggestions = optimizer.suggest_budget_limits(monthly_income, savings_rate)
```

### Data Integration
```python
# Load and process your own data
df = pd.read_csv('your_transactions.csv')
cleaned_data = preprocess_transactions(df)
forecasts = generate_forecasts(cleaned_data)
```
