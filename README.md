# Personal Expense Forecasting and Budget Optimization (Work in Progress)

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust machine learning and deep learning system to forecast personal expenses and optimize budgets across various spending categories. The goal is to help users better manage their finances by predicting future expenses based on historical data, seasonal trends, and external economic indicators.

## Problem Statement

Managing personal finances effectively is a critical challenge faced by individuals worldwide. Traditional budgeting methods are often static and fail to account for seasonal variations, lifestyle changes, and unexpected expenses. Many people struggle to predict future expenses accurately, leading to overspending, insufficient savings, and financial stress.

This project aims to develop a forecasting system that predicts personal expenses across different categories (housing, food, transportation, entertainment, etc.) based on historical spending patterns, seasonal trends, and external factors. The system will also provide budget optimization recommendations to assist users in financial planning.

## Dataset

* **User-Collected Data:** Personal bank transactions, credit card expenses, UPI/Wallet payments
* **Kaggle Datasets:** personal-expense-transaction-data and other financial datasets
* **Additional Sources:** Economic indicators such as inflation, unemployment, and interest rates
